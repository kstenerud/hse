HSE 1.1 (2006-Jul-08):
----------------------
- Added database connection loss detection and handling (see ExceptionAnalyzer and handleException() in the Screen implementations).
- Switched pooling library from dbcp to c3p0 (it should have been c3p0 in the first place).
- Cleaned up the transaction proxy cases.  Only create, update, and delete are set to read/write.
- Moved application.properties out of the classpath so that it can be dynamically reloaded.
- Added dynamic reloading support to PropertyHelper.
- Changed endSession.redirect so that it doesn't point to an absolute path.
- CriteriaBuffer now uses "true" and "false" rather than 1 and 0 for boolean values.
  If you database doesn't support this, you can set up substitutions in application.properties.
  See the Derby database values for an example.
